# Ult-TicTacToe
Like Tic-Tac-Toe, but better.

T^3 is an Android game application that expands on the idea of Tic-Tac-Toe. It provides the option for different sized boards and Artificial Intelligence or human opponents. But it also transforms the Tic-Tac-Toe experience by providing a new game entirely - Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, where every square of the big Tic-Tac-Toe board is a smaller Tic-Tac-Toe board, and your move are limited by your opponent's last claim. In this new game style, force your opponent to move into squares and struggle your way to victory.
